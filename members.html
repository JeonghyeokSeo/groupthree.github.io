<div><p> Originally from Peterborough, Ontario. Currently a GIS applications specialist at Fleming College. My alma mater is the University of Toronto, where I recieved a BSc specializing in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Here at T3 GIS Consulting, I offer clients solutions through remote sensing particularly LIDAR and creation of 3D models. Furthermore, due to my knowledge and experiance in ecology I also offer clients aid with environemental analysis and mapping. My main focus is in understaing forestation and species habitation. Here at T3 GIS Consulting, we always work in a collaborative manner to offer solutions to clients. When I am not working I enjoy biking, reading, and binge watching tv shows.
