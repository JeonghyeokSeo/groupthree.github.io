Founded in 2006, Lim Geomatics has built a trusted brand worldwide for developing and implementing innovative geospatial solutions and services because we can deliver both—thought leadership and technical leadership. Description of our company. What we do. How long we have been in service. What industry we work with.  Where we are located. </p></div>
