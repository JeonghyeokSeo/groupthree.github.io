<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Who we Are (Brief Introduction)</h2>
<p class = "class1"> Some companies have the vision to imagine how geospatial technologies can elevate their operation, but not the technical prowess to put those ideas into practice. Other organizations have the nuts-and-bolts expertise, but not the business or market awareness to capitalize on technology assets. Founded in 2006, Lim Geomatics has built a trusted brand worldwide for developing and implementing innovative geospatial solutions and services because we can deliver bothâ€”thought leadership and technical leadership. Description of our company. What we do. How long we have been in service. What industry we work with.  Where we are located. </p></div>
