<p class = "intro"> Hello, my name is Gowsigan Sritharan and welcome to the homepage of my personal website. This website is a personal advertisement and was created using the web design programming languages HTML & CSS as part of an assignment for the GEOM 101 Web Design & Programming course at Fleming College's GIS Applications Specialist program. Each page of the website showcases a variety of aspects about me including a bit about myself, my hobbies/activities, post-secondary education along with my volunteering & work experience.

<div class = "me"><h3 class = "title"> A bit about myself</h3>
<p class = "text1">I was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1996 and grew up within the Etobicoke area before moving to Brampton around 2010. I had a great interest in wildlife and nature growing up and ecided that I'd attend the University of Guelph where I completed my Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science (BSc.Envs). After university, I decided to pursue the Fleming College GIS Application Specialist Program which brings me to here now. Fleming college is a great school with a variety of comprehensive programs, here is a link to their website to learn more: <a href="https://www.flemingcollege.ca/" target="_blank">Fleming College Website</a> </p></div>
