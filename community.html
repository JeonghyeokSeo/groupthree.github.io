<div><h2>Community, News & Events</h2>
<p>Having a sense of community is important wherever life. It give us the chances to meet and learn about new people, help accompish our life goals and makes us feel safe. At T3 GIS Consulting, our members are very active in the GIS community and participate in a variety of volunteering activities, workshops, webinars/seminars and conferences. As our team is situated in Ontario, Canada our team works to help out in their respective communities be it online or in person, we help out in whatever ways that we can. Some of our members volunteer by creating content for GIS websites, perform geospatial related tasks for different mapping organizations, help out locally in GIS meetings and more. </p></div>

<div><h2>Events</h2>
<p> Members from our team participate in many different geospatial/GIS related events that are held worldwide throughout the year. From the ESRI User Conference and GIS Day to BeSpatial/URISA Ontario's Annual General Meeting (AGM), our team keeps in touch with what is going on in the geospatial world and continues to learn & grow more. This is done for a number of reasons and we do so to keep up to date with current developments in the industry, learn more in general, and which in turns improves our services. The following below are a few events in the future that some of our team members plans to attend. </p></div>

<div><h3>ESRI's GIS Day 2020. Participate in the international celebration of GIS technology.</h3> 
<p>GIS Day is a day dedicated to showing, teaching, and inspiring others. Spread enthusiasm and help people learn how to use GIS for themselves—in their work, in their schools, where they volunteer, or even for their hobbies and interests. On GIS Day, help others learn about geography and the real-world applications of GIS that are making a difference in our society. It's a chance for you to share your accomplishments and inspire others to discover and use GIS. Even though celebrating may look a little different this year, sharing GIS is more important than ever.</p>
