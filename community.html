<p class = "class1">GIS Team 3 Consulting members are active in the community and participate in workshops, events, fundraisers, trade shows and conferences. As our team is situated primarily in Ontario, Canada our team works to help out in our respective communities while also helping out in different areas in other ways that we can. Some of our members volunteer creating content for geomatics websites, complete geospatial related tasks for different organizations, and help out locally in GIS meetings. </p></div>
