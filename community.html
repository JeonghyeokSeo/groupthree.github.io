<p class = "class1">GIS Team 3 Consulting members are active in their community and participate in a variety of volunteering activities, workshops, webinars/seminars and conferences. As our team is situated in Ontario, Canada our team works to help out in our respective communities while also helping out in different areas in other ways that we can. Some of our members volunteer by creating content for GIS websites, perform geospatial related tasks for different organizations, help out locally in GIS meetings and more. </p></div>

<div class = "move"><h2 class = "title">Events</h2>
<p class = "class1"> Members from our team participate in many different geospatial/GIS related events that are held worldwide throughout the year. From the ESRI User Conference and GIS Day to BeSpatial/URISA Ontario's Annual General Meeting (AGM), our team keeps in touch with what is going on in the geospatial world and continues to grow more. This is done for a number of reasons and we do so mainly to keep up to date with current developments in the industry. The following are a few events currently and in the past that our team plans to attend, along with events in the future. Below are a few examples:
	

<div><ul>
  <li>BeSpatial/URISA Ontario's Annual General Meeting 2021. Theme: Resiliency: A glimpse into the geospatial future with creative strategies and approaches for geospatial and information professionals. Focus:  New technology implementations, location-based intelligence and workforce management.  Date: May 5, 2021. Location: Full Day Virtual Conference. </li>
</ul></div>

<div><ul>
  <li>ESRI's GIS Day 2020. Participate in the international celebration of GIS technology. GIS Day is a day dedicated to showing, teaching, and inspiring others. Spread enthusiasm and help people learn how to use GIS for themselves—in their work, in their schools, where they volunteer, or even for their hobbies and interests. On GIS Day, help others learn about geography and the real-world applications of GIS that are making a difference in our society. It's a chance for you to share your accomplishments and inspire others to discover and use GIS. Even though celebrating may look a little different this year, sharing GIS is more important than ever.</li>
